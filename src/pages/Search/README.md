# Search Module Documentation

This directory contains the search functionality components for TawasolApp, providing a LinkedIn-style search experience with filters for posts, people, and companies.

## üîç Key Features

- **Filter-based Search**: Switch between posts, people, and companies
- **Time Frame Filtering**: (SHOWN ONLY IN POST FILTER) Filter posts by recency (day, week, month, or all time)

- **Company Filtering**: (SHOWN ONLY IN PEOPLE FILTER) Option to search for users in a specific company
- **Industry Filtering**: (SHOWN ONLY IN COMPANY FILTER) Option to search for company in a specific industry

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. `SearchContainer` extracts search text from URL parameters
2. User selects desired main filter (posts, people, company) (content type, time frame, network)
3. User adds a secondary filter if wanted (posts contains recency, within network boolean while people filter has company as a secondary, etc..)
4. Appropriate search component is rendered based on selected filter and secondary filters are then passed as a prop to the component
5. Results are fetched via API calls with pagination support
6. Users can interact with results (view profiles, follow companies, etc.)
